## Python Class at MediaMath, 20150105

### Introduction

 1. The best language to start learning with.
    2. readable — not just no strange symbols, but Python culture is a culture of clarity.
    2. reasonable — since reading code is more harder than writing it, there are tools to make it as painless as possible to understand what code does.
    2. extremely well documented, both on-line and in books.
 1. This course will run from scratch, assumes nothing. You do not need any initial set-up other than what is in the course — no IDE, no virtualenv, nothing.
 1. Use Zed Shaw tutorial, "Learn Python the Hard Way". There is [on-line content](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/); textbook and videos will be accessible to you on the `shares` drive: 
 
        /Volumes/shares/Training\ Public/Quality\ Assurance/learn_python_the_hard_way

 1. Python is not named after the snake but after [Monty Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbEIX1giTho), a very silly English comedy troupe of the 1960s and 70s. In the on-line Python docs there are a lot of silly Monty Python jokes.

### How this class will run

 1. You will work through the tutorial on your own, and then we'll go over what you've done, together, here. You can ask me any questions then, or by email. You can ask me questions any time you want, and I'll do my best to answer them as soon as I see them.
 1. How much time should you spend on homework? A good rule of thumb is two-three hours of quality-time study for every hour of class. "Quality time" does not include 
 
    2. getting comfortable
    2. making a schedule
    2. checking your messages, or 
    2. reflecting on the teacher's awful haircut.

   So if we spend an hour together, I expect you to have put three good hours into Python by the next time we meet. You should try to make some time for this every day. 

### The first materials

 1. Read Section "The Hard Way Is Easier" (pp. 19-22). 
 1. Heed his warnings! Do exactly what he says. You will get the most out of the class if you do that.
 1. Actual lesson

    2. "What You Should See" (screen shots of the outcome)
    2. "Study Drills" (more things to do to make sure you understand)
    2. "Common Student Questions"
 1. For Wednesday, please do the first four "exercises":
 
    2. "0 The Setup" (pp. 24-30).
    2. "1 A Good First Program" (pp. 32-36).
    2. "2 Comments and Pound Characters" (pp. 38-39).
    2. "3 Numbers and Math" (pp. 40-42).

### Basic terminal use

 1. This course comes with a whole [mini-course in how to use a terminal](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html), which I know frightens some people. This is a good time to learn the basics, if you haven't already.
 1. Please find the course and do exercises 1-6 for the next class.
 1. Basic commands:
    2. `pwd`
    2. `mkdir`
    2. `cd`
    2. `ls`

### Ground rules of my class

 1. Help each other — it's not a competition.
 1. Don't do or say anything to make anyone else feel lousy. Make each other feel supported. I expect you to make things easy on one another.
 1. You are not on trial here, and I am not the judge or the jury. I hope to be your coach and cheerleader!
