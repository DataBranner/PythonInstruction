 * [Exercise 26: Congratulations, Take A Test!](http://learnpythongthehardway.org/book/ex26.html)
 * **That last exercise, #26, is important**. Leave time to spend on it. Then send it to me by email (or send me a link by email, but be sure the link works, please). This is **due** no later than 11:00 p.m. on Tuesday, 20 January, 2015, Eastern Standard Time (New York local time).


### Work due next class (20140121) in the command-line crash-course

 * First, practice everything you've learned so far.
 * Second, please read [Next Steps](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/next.html) and examine the references the author points you to. Read in them (the manuals may be too long to read) and experiment with some of the things that interest you or look useful. 
 * Pick something that we haven't discussed yet and come in prepared to talk about it to the class.

.* It stands for "argument vector" â€” arguments are pieces of data passed to a function; a vector is a series of things.
